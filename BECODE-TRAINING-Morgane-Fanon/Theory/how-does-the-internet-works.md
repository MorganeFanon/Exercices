# How does the internet work

## [Summary of the following video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)

Internet is not a bubble cloud, it is a wire (buried in the ground). It makes it possible for two different computers to communicate together. Actually these two computers are called servers and each of them has its own IP-adress, which is their geographical position. The IP-adress is a serie of numbers like 678.205.46.248 but they are also called by a name like Securitycatalyst.com for example.

Web pages and files are situated on these servers. Your pc at home is not a server as it is not directly connected to the internet. This is a client. Internet service providers are the ones who link your computer to the internet.
Some servers are also internet service providers as aol.com. E.g. when sending an email to aunt Ruth. From my Gmail-account I want to send an email to aunt Ruth who has an AOL-account. I log to my gmail account, compose a message and send it. Gmail send my email to aol.com.

What is send throughout email is divided into small pieces called packets, when the email arrives at its final destination the pieces are reassembled into one unit.

EVERYTHING connected directly/indirectly to the internet has an IP-adress (computers, servers, cell-phones and all the in-between-equipment).
Routers directs your packets into the internet, everytime you're sending go through a router and gets a particular layer making it possible to find it's way back to your computer once it has reached the website of Facebook, for example.
