# How does the internet work

 Anne's contribution :

 The internet is a wonderful thing but it is not located on a cloud. In reality, it is burried on the ground and it is a big wire composed of optic fiber, copper, cables. A bunch of servers are connected to this wire.

## [Summary of the following video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)

Internet is not a bubble cloud, it is a wire (buried in the ground). it makes it possible for two different computers to communicate together. Actually these two computers are called servers and each of them has its own IP-adress, which is their geographical position. The IP-adress is a serie of numbers like 678.205.46.248 but they are also called by a name like Securitycatalyst.com for example. 

Web pages and files are situated on these servers. Your pc at home is not a server as it is not directly connected to the internet. This is a client. It is internet service providers who links your computer to the internet. 
Some servers are also internet service providers as aol.com. E.g. when sending an email to aunt Ruth. From my Gmail-account I want to send an email to aunt Ruth who has an AOL-account.  I log to my gmail account, compose an message and send it. Gmail send my email to aol.com.

what is send throughout email is divided into small pieces called packets, when the email arrives at its finale destination the pieces are reassembled into one unit.

EVERYTHING connected directly/indirectly to the internet has an IP-adress (computers, servers, cell-phones and all the in-between-equipment).
